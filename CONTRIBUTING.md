Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Guidelines
- For small fixes (typos, docs), open a Pull Request directly.
- For larger changes or new features, please open an Issue first to discuss the design.
- Keep changes focused and include tests where appropriate.

Workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`.
3. Commit changes with clear messages.
4. Open a PR against the main branch.

Code style
- Keep the code simple and readable. Follow PEP8 where reasonable.
- Add brief docstrings for new functions.

Thanks — maintainers will review PRs and provide feedback.
